        # The Software Engineering Project was done in a group of 5. We developed a desktop application for wedding planning agencies to efficiently manage and match clients to vendor companies based on profile information available. It has a Graphical User Interface (GUI), but most of the user interactions occurs through a Command Line Interface (CLI). The project was adapted and enhanced from an existing software application developed by the courseâ€™s core team.
      </p>

        ## The Independent Software Development Project (Orbital) was done as a pair over the 2018 summer break (May - Aug). We developed a fully functional Android Real-time Multiplayer game written in Java that integrated various services such as Google Real-time Multiplayer and Google Achievements. This project subsequently won Best Project (Advanced Level) for Orbital 2018.
